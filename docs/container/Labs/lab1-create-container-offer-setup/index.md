# Lab 1 - Partner Center Setup for a Container Offer

> **Note:** This lab is part of a series of labs for Mastering Container Offers Workshop. You must finish this lab before moving on to the next sections.

This lab will walk you through setting up a Container Offer in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/marketplace-offers/overview). You will need a Partner Center account and need to have enrolled into the commercial marketplace program in order to be able to create offers in the marketplace.

## Create a new Container Offer

In this section you will be creating a brand new Container Offer from scratch. This will be used for publishing the offer once the rest of your labs are complete.

1. On the Homepage of Partner Center, look for Marketplace Offers and click that tile. If you have disabled Workspaces, then it will be visible as Commercial Marketplace.
2. Click the **+ New Offer** button and select **Azure Container** from the dropdown.
3. Enter a unique **Offer ID** and an **Offer Alias** as described below.
    - Offer ID: **containerworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING** (Replace the **YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING** with a value of your choice)
    - Offer Alias: **Container Workshop**
    - Submit the new offer.
4. Once the offer is created, navigate to the **Offer Setup** page by clicking on that tab on the left

## Offer Setup

The Offer Setup page allows changing your offer alias as well as as other functions. For the purpose of this lab, we will leave everything as is and only configure the **Setup details** and **Customer leads** sections.

### Setup details

1. Under **Setup details** check **Yes, I would like to sell through Microsoft and have Microsoft host transactions on my behalf**

### Customer leads

Here, you will attach your offer to an Azure Data Storage table which will act as a connected Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) for your offer. This is where sales leads will be collected.

It is recommended you install all the resources you'll create in this class into the same Resource Group, just to keep things tidy.

#### Create the Azure Storage account

1. Open a new tab for the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in.
2. In the **containerworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING** Resource Group, create a standard Azure Storage account. This will be your CRM database, so name it **containerworkshopscrmUNIQUE_STRING**. rEPLACE **UNIQUE_STRING** with a different value. 
   
    > üóíÔ∏è Note all characters are lower case for naming a storage account and no non-alphanumeric characters are allowed.

3. Once the storage account is created, browse to the storage account's **Overview** page.
4. In the left-hand menu, find the **Security + networking** section.
5. Uner the **key1** section click the **Show** button next to the **Connection string** hidden value.
6. Copy a connection string to your copy/paste buffer.

#### Configure Customer Leads in Partner Center

1. Go back to the Partner Center **Customer leads** in your browser.
2. Select the **Connect** link.
3. From the **Lead destination** dropdown, select **Azure Table**.
4. Enter your **Contact email** and paste in your **Storage account connection string**.
5. Click the **Validate** link to ensure your connection string is valid.
6. Click **Connect**.
7. CLick teh **Connect** button.

    > üóíÔ∏èFor each page in Partner Center, you must click the **Save draft** at the bottom of the page before moving on.

8. Click **Save draft** at the bottom of the page.

3. In the **Privacy policy link**, enter the public link to the privacy policy for your company if you know it. If not, use the following link: `https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement`.

5. In the **Engineering Contact** section, enter your engineering contact information.
6. For the Marketplace media section you'll upload 2 images.
    1. For the **216X216 logo image,** upload the PNG provided in the `./items` directory of **lab1**. This PNG is named "**Contoso-Logo-216x216.png**."

### Preview audience

### Plan overview

Skip this section for this lab. You will come back to it later.

## Review and Publish

Here, you can check your work by performing the first action of the publication process. You will submit your offer to an automated compliance checker to see if it is ready to be published.

1. Navigate to the **Offer overview** page.
1. In the upper right corner of the page, click the link for **Review and publish**.
1. Looking to the right side of the page, notice that some sections have a green circle and at least one is gray. The gray sections are not yet complete, preventing you from taking the next step of publishing your offer.

    > üóíÔ∏èThe **Plan overview** section of the offer will not pass review and should be gray. This is okay for now as we need to fill out the **Plan overview** tab and you can't do that until we have a VM image. All other sections should be green.

1. Ensure all sections pass and are green except **Plan overview**, which will be addressed in the next lab.
1. Go back to all other sections that appear with a gray circle and complete those sections with the guidance provided above.

**Congratulations!** You have now finished this lab.
