## SaaS Accelerator

The SaaS Accelerator provides a fully functional community-led SaaS reference implementation for those interested in publishing transactable SaaS offers in Microsoft's marketplace in hours instead of days. In support of the Saas Accelerator, the Mastering the Marketplace content library has a complete course on how to build a SaaS offer using the SaaS Accelerator.

## SaaS client libraries and REST scripts

The SaaS client libraries help you build your SaaS offer. The libraries provide strongly-typed wrappers on top of the SaaS Fulfillment and Metered Billing APIs that you can use in building your own integrations to the marketplace.
