## Hands-on labs

Although the above videos take you through some great materials on various aspects of selling your Teams application, Teams App Camp is fundamentally about building your skills through labs that you can do at your own pace.

### Labs overview

The labs are hosted on another site, [Microsoft Teams App Camp](https://aka.ms/app-camp). But this section will guide you down the path of the labs you need to complete to understanding how to build a Teams app that can be sold in the marketplace. The application code involved is plain JavaScript without a framework like Angular or React.js behind it, to keep things platform neutral and as simple as possible.

### üß™Lab order and links

The labs are structured as a series of 3 required labs followed by a "Choose your own adventure" style of labs such that you can explore on your own. Here, you'll find information on four labs, the three required ones plus the lab, "Selling Your SaaS-based Teams Extension."

The videos in the next section will help you through each lab.

1. [Setting up the application with Azure AD](https://microsoft.github.io/app-camp/aad/A01-begin-app/)
2. [Creating a Teams app with Azure ADO SSO](https://microsoft.github.io/app-camp/aad/A02-after-teams-sso/)
3. [Teams styling and themes](https://microsoft.github.io/app-camp/aad/A03-after-apply-styling/)
4. [Selling Your SaaS-based Teams Extension](https://microsoft.github.io/app-camp/aad/Monetization/)

### About the lab videos

The following videos will take you through the labs in detail so you can learn by example. Feel free to play and pause the videos as you follow along, building your own Teams application.

If you'd like to watch the labs before doing them, they are here. They're also posted at the beginning of each lab. The instructions should stand on their own - you don't need to watch in order to complete the labs - but they can help if you get stuck or want to understand the labs more deeply.
